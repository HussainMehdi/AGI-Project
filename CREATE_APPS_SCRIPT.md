# App Creation Script

Due to the large scope, I'll create each app with:
1. Build configuration
2. Basic app structure (Application, MainActivity)
3. Core data models
4. Key screens (list, detail, cart/booking)
5. NLP prompt integration
6. Sample offline data

Each app will be functional and testable with the Assistant SDK.
