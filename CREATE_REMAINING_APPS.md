# Creating Remaining 5 Apps

I'll create all 5 remaining apps following the ecommerce pattern:
1. Food Delivery - Restaurants, menu items, cart
2. Ride Hailing - Drivers, booking, trip history
3. Calendar - Events, create/edit events
4. Marketplace - Apps, install, search
5. LMS - Courses, assignments, submissions

Each will have:
- Build config
- Application class
- Main activity with list
- Detail/book/install activities
- Sample data
- NLP integration
- Cart/booking managers
